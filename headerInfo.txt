Review the HTTP Headers in the Request and Response – create text file and describe
each key value pair in the HTTP header in both request and response and check it in
with the project to GitHub (e.g. what is the content-type and what does it mean)

Alt-Svc →hq=":443"; ma=2592000; quic=51303431; quic=51303339; quic=51303338; quic=51303337; quic=51303335,quic=":443"; ma=2592000; v="41,39,38,37,35"
The time identity and location of a Web resource which are usually shared, can be changed using the Alt-Svc header.

Cache-Control →private, max-age=0, must-revalidate, no-transform

Indicates the media type of the entity-body sent to the recipient.

The date and the time when the message was initiated.

ETag →"f6QLsd8inUgRKJVNBqJ8xHnPb0w/drp1qLdLPoCQBhL78ItdfQfQ9Aw"
Provides the current value of the entity tag for the requested variant. A mechanism that HTTP provides for web cache validation.

Expires →Fri, 02 Feb 2018 20:59:01 GMT
